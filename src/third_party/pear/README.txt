PEAR Libraries
====================================================================


This directory (third_party/pear) contains unmodified copies of some
libraries from the standard PEAR distribution (http://pear.php.net).

We include these in BoA solely for the convenience of sites that
may not have PEAR installed.

If this directory is DELETED from BoA then BoA will search
the standard PHP directories and use the PEAR libraries there instead.
